# Testing

Last updated: 2026-04-07

## Local Setup

From the repo root:

```sh
cd /Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android
make bootstrap
make doctor
```

The helper environment does the following:
- resolves Android Studio bundled JDK instead of shell Java 11
- uses repo-local Gradle state where possible
- exposes Android SDK platform tools in PATH

## Build And Static Checks

Build debug APK:

```sh
make build
```

Run unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

Current behavior:
- always runs `testDebugUnitTest`
- also runs `connectedDebugAndroidTest` when `adb devices` reports at least one attached target in `device` state
- prints a skip message and exits successfully after unit tests when no device/emulator is connected

Run lint:

```sh
make lint
```

Current verified result:
- all three commands pass in this repo
- debug APK was installed and launched on a physical Android phone over wireless debugging

Latest verification attempt:
- `make test` was rerun after adding Compose shell smoke tests
- the run is currently blocked before connected test execution by unrelated compile errors in [VisitedModels.kt](/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/core/model/src/main/java/com/iloapps/nomaddashboard/core/model/VisitedModels.kt), which belongs to the active visited-place / country-day workstream

## APK Location

Current debug APK output:

- [app-debug.apk](/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk)

## Install On A Phone

### USB

1. Enable Developer Options.
2. Enable USB debugging.
3. Connect the phone by USB.
4. Accept the trust/debug prompt on the phone.
5. Verify:

```sh
adb devices -l
```

6. Install and launch:

```sh
make run
```

Or install manually:

```sh
adb install -r /Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Wi-Fi / Wireless Debugging

1. On the phone, enable `Wireless debugging` in Developer Options.
2. Choose `Pair device with pairing code`.
3. Run:

```sh
make connect-wireless
```

The helper will prompt for:
- `PHONE_IP:PAIR_PORT`
- pairing code
- `PHONE_IP:CONNECT_PORT`

Then install and launch:

```sh
make run
```

Current repo status:
- verified working on a physical device after wireless ADB reconnect

## Troubleshooting Install Failures

### `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`

This means the phone blocked the installation. The Android app built correctly,
but the device refused the ADB install.

This is especially common on Xiaomi / Redmi / HyperOS / MIUI devices.

Try these steps on the phone:

1. Open `Settings > Developer options`.
2. Enable `USB debugging`.
3. Enable `Install via USB`.
4. If present, enable `USB debugging (Security settings)`.
5. Keep the phone unlocked and watch for an install/security confirmation.
6. If it still fails, temporarily disable `MIUI optimization` or `HyperOS optimization`, then retry.

Retry:

```sh
make run
```

Notes:
- The app already built successfully if the error appears during install.
- On some Xiaomi devices, the install confirmation appears as a system prompt or
  notification rather than a full-screen dialog.
- Wireless debugging still requires the device to allow ADB-driven installs.

## Run From Android Studio

1. Open `/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android` in Android Studio.
2. Let Gradle sync.
3. Select your emulator or phone.
4. Press Run.

## Manual Smoke Checklist

Perform these checks on the first installed build:

### App shell

- app launches without crash
- bottom navigation appears on phone
- navigation rail appears on larger window sizes
- all five top-level destinations open

### Dashboard

- refresh button works
- connectivity information renders
- battery information renders
- public IP or travel context is shown when network is available
- weather section shows data when IP geolocation returns coordinates

### Settings

- toggles change state
- settings persist after app relaunch
- card reordering works
- card width toggling persists

### Build and environment

- `make build` still succeeds after app launch
- `make test` still succeeds
- `make lint` still succeeds

## Current Automated Coverage

Implemented now:
- settings proto round-trip unit test
- Compose UI smoke tests for:
  - app launch into dashboard
  - top-level navigation across all five shell destinations
  - stable dashboard shell rendering without live-network assertions
  - persisted `Expand weather forecast` toggle across activity recreation

File:
- [SettingsProtoMapperTest.kt](/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/core/datastore/src/test/java/com/iloapps/nomaddashboard/core/datastore/SettingsProtoMapperTest.kt)
- [MainActivitySmokeTest.kt](/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/iloapps/nomaddashboard/MainActivitySmokeTest.kt)
- [SettingsSmokeTest.kt](/Users/matti/Development/ILOapps/nomad-dashboard-android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/iloapps/nomaddashboard/SettingsSmokeTest.kt)

Planned next:
- repository refresh tests
- storage migration tests
- visited-country-day logic tests
- time-tracking ledger tests

Recommended parallel task while visited-data work is in progress:
- rerun [parallel-task-ui-smoke-tests.md](./parallel-task-ui-smoke-tests.md) verification once the active visited-data compile blocker is resolved
